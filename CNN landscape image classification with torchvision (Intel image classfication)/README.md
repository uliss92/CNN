# Given the Image Classification dataset consists of 6 classes, I am asked to build a model that can correctly classify images.

## This image data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
** All images are divided into 6 classes: **
	{'buildings' -> 0,
	'forest' -> 1,
	'glacier' -> 2,
	'mountain' -> 3,
	'sea' -> 4,
	'street' -> 5 }
